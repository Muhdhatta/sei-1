## Important Policies

Please read and adhere to the following, otherwise bad things might happen.

#### Prework

You should have completed the following in preparation for the course. This is to ensure that you can handle the pace of the class.

* [GA Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)
* [WDI Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly/)
* [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)

#### Attendance

Our attendance policy for graduation is no more than 4 absences during the course. 15 minutes late = 1 tardy. 3 tardies = 1 absence.

If you know you'll be late or absent, please let us know and we'll arrange to have your tardy or absence excused.

#### Practice Work and Projects

**Homework:** Pull requests have to be submitted by 9am the next day regardless of completion status.

**Projects:** Everyone should complete the minimum requirements for each project in order for this course to be considered completed.

**Submissions:** Via github [pull request.](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2019/01-workflow/how-to-practice.html)

#### Project Presentation Format

At the end of project week, all students will have the opportunity to share their hard work with the rest of the class. (Fun!)

There will be 2 parts to project presentation day:

  1. Individual project presentations
  2. Post-mortem

#### Individual Project Presentations

Every student gets __5 minutes__ to _demo_ her/his project to the class.

Show the product, not talk about specific parts of code, unless it's something really interesting!

If you are not presenting, note down questions/comments you have for the presenter because later on, you'll be able to ask/tell them...

#### Post-Mortems (After Project Presentations)

Finally, we'll do 1-on-1 project post-mortems with all students. Read details about [post-mortem format](project-1/project-post-mortem.md) (note: you'll need to prepare for it).
